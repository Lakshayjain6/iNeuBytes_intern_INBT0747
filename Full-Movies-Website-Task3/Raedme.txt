Throughout the project, I remained cautious about copyright and legal implications. 
I made sure to use legitimate sources for movie data and images to respect copyright laws.

In conclusion, building the Netflix clone with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was an incredible learning experience.
Despite the difficulties I faced, I am proud of the final product and the skills I honed throughout the process.
With the guidance of Ineubytes and my determination, I successfully completed the project and look forward to embarking on more challenging endeavors in the future.
